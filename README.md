# Chess-Master

We created a custom chess game using Java AWT and Swing package that uses a two-dimensional octagonal
board (i.e., 8 sides, each horizontal or vertical side has a length of 5 cells).

The game requires two human players taking turns to move their chess pieces across the board. Each
player has a pawn, knight, rook, bishop, queen and king, arranged at the start The standard chess rules apply with an
extra condition that a piece has to travel through existing cell(s) whilst completing a legal move. For
example, a knight in Fig. 2. may move to B from A via the blue-coloured path. The red-coloured path is
invalid since it requires the knight to travel through a non-existing cell.
The Game has a start button to automatically place the pieces on the board when the user presses it. A
restart button is to reset the game.
